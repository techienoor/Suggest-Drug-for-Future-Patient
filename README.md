# Suggest-Drug-for-Future-Patient
In this Repo, we will learn a popular machine learning algorithm, <b>Decision Tree</b>. 
We will use this classification algorithm to build a model from historical data of patients, and their respond to different medications. 
Then we use the trained decision tree to predict the class of a unknown patient, or to find a proper drug for a new patient.
